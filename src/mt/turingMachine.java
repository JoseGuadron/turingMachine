//Porpuse: The Turing Machine is designed to check if a string is accepted or rejected base on a specific criteria. The criteria 
//of the string is that only can have '1' and 'A/a'. Also, the '1' should be all before we write an 'A/a'. The string should have more 'A/a' than '1'
//Example of accepted string: 11AA, 11AAAA, 111AaAAA
//Example of rejected string: 111A, 11A1AAA, A1111aA
